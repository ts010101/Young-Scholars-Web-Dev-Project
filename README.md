Utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this web dev project. 
This website aims to aims to motivate K-12 students to pursue higher education and provide educational resources 
such as tutoring (links to Khan Academy videos) and career exploration within the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). 
I have met the following requirements for this project:

-The webpages should be presentable as a whole; the interface should be user friendly (text should be easy to read).
-The website should contain pictures and/or videos, and they should be presentable as well (placed in a proper place, easy to see, have proper size and resolution).
-The website has 1 homepage and at least 3 subpages; the homepage and subpages have a horizontal menu that leads to the other pages. This means 4 total pages will be required.
-The homepage has picture carousel animation (slideshow effect).
-This needs to autoscroll and have forward and back buttons.
-Have a scroll box in one page. You can put text only or text with pictures inside the scroll box.  The scroll box should have something like a scroll bar to allow users rolling it up and down. Some students have scroll boxes show up after submitting the form, if this is the case make sure you add a comment to the grading TA letting them know.
-One page has a form either submit via get or post (enter the email and subscribe, a short survey, etc.)  
-One page has an unordered HTML list with several entries. The horizontal menu does not count for this requirement.
-There is one button to download files (map to the farm, menu in the restaurant, a personal CV, etc.) The downloaded file can either open in the browser or download to the local computer.
-There is a link that you can click and leads to outside webpages (LinkedIn, Yelp, email, etc.)
-You are allowed to add other features not listed above to your website as long as they are functional and serve some purpose in your website.
-You should use at least HTML/CSS and JavaScript in your project.
